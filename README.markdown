## Interview project

This implementation uses an in-memory Map to store the counts and all
pertinent information regarding the media files is received on the endpoint
/event. Given such, there is no need to connect to DropBox or to specify
DropBox credentials.

To test one can construct the /event POST and the /report GET using a
REST API tester (such as the Advanced Rest Client [Google Chrome plugin]).
